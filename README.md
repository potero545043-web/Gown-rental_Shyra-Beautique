## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Vercel deployment

The Vercel adapter in `vercel.json` builds the Vite assets, routes Laravel through the PHP runtime, and exposes a server-side Vercel Blob bridge. Public gown and accessory images use a public Blob store. Government ID images use a separate private Blob store and are delivered only through the existing authenticated Laravel routes.

Before creating a deployment:

1. Import this repository into Vercel and use the `Other` framework preset.
2. Keep the existing Blob store private and create a second Blob store with public access. Connect both stores to the Vercel project, using the prefixes `PRIVATE_BLOB` and `PUBLIC_BLOB` for their generated store-ID variables. The SDK uses Vercel's automatically managed OIDC token; read-write tokens with the matching prefixes are only needed outside Vercel.
3. Add a strong, random `BLOB_BRIDGE_SECRET` as a Vercel environment variable. Never put Blob tokens, the bridge secret, database passwords, or `APP_KEY` in Git or chat.
4. Add the app environment variables in Vercel: `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, a generated `APP_KEY`, `APP_URL`, `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT=4000`, `DB_DATABASE=gownrentalsystem`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `SESSION_DRIVER=database`, `CACHE_STORE=database`, and `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`. The TiDB TLS root certificate is bundled at `certs/isrgrootx1.pem`; the MySQL connection verifies the server certificate using it by default on Vercel.
5. Deploy to Preview first. Back up the intended TiDB database, then run `php artisan migrate --force` once from a secure deployment environment. Do not add migrations to the build command.

The Blob bridge accepts only validated image uploads up to 4 MB, requires a server-only shared secret, and restricts private-file reads to private Blob URLs. Storage credentials must be configured in Vercel before testing uploads. Vercel's function request-size limits still apply, so larger files must be reduced before upload.
